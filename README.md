# UltraNumber-v1.1
UltraNumber as a reusable library not a standalone program. However, it does come with a standalone executable calculator for demo purposes.

When I downloaded the executable to test it on my system, Windows flagged it as a virus. It's not, it just doesn't have a userbase yet.
Feel free to compile the code on your own system.
