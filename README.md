# UltraNumber-v1.1
UltraNumber v1.1 is a modification of the original UltraNumber Program. A program that can work with exceptionally long numbers that exceed all integer based data types in C++. 

This particular version is designed as a reusable library not a standalone program. However, it does come with a standalone executable calculator for demo purposes.

When I downloaded the executable to test it on my system, Windows flagged it as a virus. It's not, it just doesn't have a userbase yet.
Feel free to compile the code on your own system.
